I am a second year PhD student in the Accelerated Connected Computing Lab (ACCL) at KAUST. I mainly work on the Neural Network inference across edge, cloudlet and cloud. I also work on split computing, reconfigurable computing systems, and have explored machine learning model compression and physically unclonable functions. 
I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering and my Master's degree in Cyber Science and Technology from Beihang University, Beijing, China in 2019 and 2021, respectively.
